	   summary: "Katherine Johnson was born in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia in 1918, her intense curiosity and brilliance with numbers vaulted her ahead several grades in school. By ten, she was attending the high school on the campus of historically black West Virginia State College. At fourteen, she enrolled in the college itself, where she made quick work of the school’s math curriculum and found a mentor in math professor W. W. Schieffelin Claytor, the third African American to earn a PhD in Mathematics. Two years later, Katherine was handpicked to be one of three black students to integrate West Virginia’s graduate school, although she quit after one year, after becoming pregnant and choosing to focus on her family. This didn't stop her, she became as a NASA employed mathematician whose calculations of orbital mechanics were critical to the success of the first and subsequent U.S. crewed spaceflights."

	   summary: "Donna Strickland was born on 27 May 1959, in Guelph, Ontario, Canada. After graduating from Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute, she decided to attend McMaster University because its engineering physics program included lasers and electro-optics, areas of particular interest. At McMaster, she was one of three women in a class of twenty-five. While conducting her doctoral research, Strickland and her supervisor Mourou worked to develop an experimental setup that could raise the peak power of laser pulses. This work earned them the 2018 Nobel Prize in Physics."

	   summary: "Maria Goeppert was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz, a Silesian city in Prussia. In 1921, she entered the Frauenstudium, a private high school run by suffragettes that aimed to prepare girls for university. In the Spring of 1924, Goeppert entered the University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics and physics. In 1930 Goeppert married Joseph Mayer and the couple moved to the United States, where Joseph had been offered a position at Johns Hopkins University. Strict rules against nepotism prevented Johns Hopkins University from hiring Maria as a faculty member. By this time, these rules had lost their original purpose and were primarily used to prevent the employment of women married to faculty members. Through her friend Edward Teller, Maria was given a position a position working on the Manhattan Project, first at Columbia University then Los Alamos Laboratory. After this, Maria developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, which she published in 1950 and earned her the 1963 Nobel Prize in physics."

	   summary: "Marie Skłodowska Curie was born in Warsaw, in Congress Poland in the Russian Empire, on the 7th of November 1867. Her family had lost their fortune through patriotic involvements in Polish national uprisings toward Poland's independence, which condemned Maria and her elder siblings to a difficult struggle to get ahead in life. Unable to enroll in a regular institution of higher education because she was a woman, she and her sister became involved with the clandestine Flying University, a Polish patriotic institution of higher learning that admitted women students. In late 1891, Maria left Poland for France and became Marie and at the University of Paris Marie proceeded with her studies of physics, chemistry, and mathematics. In 1894 she was denied a place at Kraków University because she was a woman and a letter from Pierre Curie convinced her to return to Paris to pursue a Ph.D. While working in her lab Marie discovered that uranium rays caused the air around a sample to conduct electricity, and that other minerals also had stronger activities. In 1898, Curie and her husband announced the existence of two elements which they named "polonium" and "radium". The 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics Was awarded to the Curie's and Henri Becquerel for their discovery of radiation, which Marie Curie was the first woman to ever win. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences honored Marie Curie a second time with the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, making her the first person and the only woman to win the Nobel prize twice. Afterwards, during the first world war she became the director of the Red Cross Radiology Service and set up France's first military radiology centre."

	   summary: "Irène Joliot-Curie was born 12 September, 1897 to famous scientists Marie Curie and Pierre Curie, which makes her part of the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. To properly educate Irène, Marie joined forces with a number of eminent French scholars to form "The Cooperative", which included a private gathering of nine students that were children of the most distinguished academics in France. Each contributed to educating one another's children in their respective homes. During the first world war Irène took a nursing course during college to assist her mother in the field as her assistant radiographer. After the war, Irène returned to the Sorbonne in Paris to complete her degree in mathematics and physics in 1918. Irène then went to work as her mother's assistant at the Radium Institute where her doctoral thesis was concerned with the alpha decay of polonium, the element discovered by her parents. In 1934, Irène and her husband Frédéric realised the alchemist's dream of turning one element into another: creating radioactive nitrogen from boron, radioactive isotopes of phosphorus from aluminium, and silicon from magnesium. This discovery is formally known as positron emission or beta decay and earned them the 1935 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Irène was also proud member of the Socialist Party and she took great pains to keep atomic research out of Nazi hands, sealing and hiding their research as Germany occupied their country."

	   summary: "Rita Levi-Montalcini was born on 22 April 1909 in Turin, to a Sephardic Jewish family. In her teenage years she considered becoming a writer, but after seeing a close family friend die of stomach cancer she decided to attend the University of Turin Medical School. Her father discouraged his daughters from attending college, as he feared it would disrupt their potential lives as wives and mothers, but eventually he supported Levi-Montalcini's aspirations. After graduating summa cum laude M.D. in 1936, she remained at the university as Levi's assistant, but her academic career was cut short by Benito Mussolini's 1938 Manifesto of Race and the subsequent introduction of laws barring Jews from academic and professional careers. During World War II she set up a laboratory in her bedroom and studied the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, which laid the groundwork for much of her later research. When the Germans invaded Italy in September 1943, her family fled south to Florence, where they survived the Holocaust, under false identities, protected by some non-Jewish friends. Once again she set up a laboratory in her hiding place, in a corner of their shared living space. Washington University in St. Louis offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating nerve growth factor. This is what earned her the 1986 Nobel Prize in Medicine."

	   summary: "Rosalind Franklin was born on 25 July 1920 in 50 Chepstow Villas, Notting Hill, London, into an affluent and influential British Jewish family. Franklin's parents helped settle Jewish refugees from Europe who had escaped the Nazis, particularly those from the Kindertransport. She was 11 when she went to St Paul's Girls' School, West London, one of the few girls' schools in London that taught physics and chemistry. With six distinctions, she passed her matriculation in 1938, winning a scholarship for university, her father asked her to give the scholarship to a deserving refugee student. Franklin studied chemistry at Newnham College, Cambridge starting in 1938 and recieved her Ph.D from Cambridge university in 1945. In 1950, Franklin was granted a three-year Turner & Newall Fellowship to work at King's College London. She was originally appointed to work on X-ray diffraction of proteins and lipids in solution, but Randall, her director, redirected her work to DNA fibres. The X-ray diffraction pictures, including the landmark Photo 51 taken by Franklin's student Gosling, proved the helical shape of DNA. James Watson and Francis Crick then covertly used her data to publish a proposed model for DNA without giving her any credit for her work."

Bondar flew on the NASA Space Shuttle Discovery during Mission STS-42, January 22–30, 1992, during which she performed experiments in the Spacelab. This made her Canada's first female astronaut and the first neurologist in space. After her astronaut career, Bondar led an international team of researchers at NASA for more than a decade, examining data obtained from astronauts on space missions to better understand the mechanisms underlying the body's ability to recover from exposure to space."
